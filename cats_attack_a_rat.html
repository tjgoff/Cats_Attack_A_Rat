In the game Cats Attack A Rat, your goal is to guide the Rat, Brie, to stay
away from the cats, Willy, Whiskers, Wendy and Bob, for as long as possible.
Each cat has a distinct style of attack which will allow you to anticipate 
their behavior, and even manipulate them in order to keep a safe path open 
for escape.

The game is largely inspired by Pac Man, and has several references to the
original game.
